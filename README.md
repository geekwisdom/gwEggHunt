# GeekWisdom - Easter Egg Hunt

> We are all in this together.

Last week, I was having a Skype conversation with a collegue, and she was sharing 
some ideas she had for spreading happiness to some of her neigbours with Easter 
comming up, and most people unable to travel anywhere do to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Her optimism inspired me to create this "virtual Easter Egg" game using pictures 
from my local park located in Hanwell, NB, Canada.

Even though we cannot gather in public places. We can still bring out our community
spirit, and so I created this simple easter egg game. Free for anyone to use or
modify


## Getting Started

To use this on your own, simply host the files in your favorite webbrowser, mark-up the
egghunt.html as you wish. Feel free to use your own images, by either giving them the
same names as in this file, or by updating the settings file accordingly.

If you display the app with 'Developer' Console turned on you can cilck arond and get
and idea of how to update the eggdata.js accordingly.

Enjoy !
